# Use Claude Code features in the SDK

> Load project instructions, skills, hooks, and other Claude Code features into your SDK agents.

The Agent SDK is built on the same foundation as Claude Code, which means your SDK agents have access to the same filesystem-based features: project instructions (`CLAUDE.md` and rules), skills, hooks, and more.

By default, the SDK loads no filesystem settings. Your agent runs in isolation mode with only what you pass programmatically. To load CLAUDE.md, skills, or filesystem hooks, set `settingSources` to tell the SDK where to look.

For a conceptual overview of what each feature does and when to use it, see [Extend Claude Code](/en/features-overview).

## Enable Claude Code features with settingSources

The setting sources option ([`setting_sources`](/en/agent-sdk/python#claude-agent-options) in Python, [`settingSources`](/en/agent-sdk/typescript#setting-source) in TypeScript) controls which filesystem-based settings the SDK loads. Without it, your agent won't discover skills, `CLAUDE.md` files, or project-level hooks.

This example loads both user-level and project-level settings by setting `settingSources` to `["user", "project"]`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions, AssistantMessage, ResultMessage

  async for message in query(
      prompt="Help me refactor the auth module",
      options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
          # "user" loads from ~/.claude/, "project" loads from ./.claude/ in cwd.
          # Together they give the agent access to CLAUDE.md, skills, hooks, and
          # permissions from both locations.
          setting_sources=["user", "project"],
          allowed_tools=["Read", "Edit", "Bash"],
      ),
  ):
      if isinstance(message, AssistantMessage):
          for block in message.content:
              if hasattr(block, "text"):
                  print(block.text)
      if isinstance(message, ResultMessage) and message.subtype == "success":
          print(f"\nResult: {message.result}")
  ```

  ```typescript TypeScript theme={null}
  import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

  for await (const message of query({
    prompt: "Help me refactor the auth module",
    options: {
      // "user" loads from ~/.claude/, "project" loads from ./.claude/ in cwd.
      // Together they give the agent access to CLAUDE.md, skills, hooks, and
      // permissions from both locations.
      settingSources: ["user", "project"],
      allowedTools: ["Read", "Edit", "Bash"]
    }
  })) {
    if (message.type === "assistant") {
      for (const block of message.message.content) {
        if (block.type === "text") console.log(block.text);
      }
    }
    if (message.type === "result" && message.subtype === "success") {
      console.log(`\nResult: ${message.result}`);
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Each source loads settings from a specific location, where `<cwd>` is the working directory you pass via the `cwd` option (or the process's current directory if unset). For the full type definition, see [`SettingSource`](/en/agent-sdk/typescript#setting-source) (TypeScript) or [`SettingSource`](/en/agent-sdk/python#setting-source) (Python).

| Source      | What it loads                                                                                   | Location                                                                                                                            |
| :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"project"` | Project CLAUDE.md, `.claude/rules/*.md`, project skills, project hooks, project `settings.json` | `<cwd>/.claude/` and each parent directory up to the filesystem root (stopping when a `.claude/` is found or no more parents exist) |
| `"user"`    | User CLAUDE.md, `~/.claude/rules/*.md`, user skills, user settings                              | `~/.claude/`                                                                                                                        |
| `"local"`   | CLAUDE.local.md (gitignored), `.claude/settings.local.json`                                     | `<cwd>/`                                                                                                                            |

To match the full Claude Code CLI behavior, use `["user", "project", "local"]`.

<Warning>
  The `cwd` option determines where the SDK looks for project settings. If neither `cwd` nor any of its parent directories contains a `.claude/` folder, project-level features won't load. Auto memory (the `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/` directory that Claude Code uses to persist notes across interactive sessions) is a CLI-only feature and is never loaded by the SDK.
</Warning>

## Project instructions (CLAUDE.md and rules)

`CLAUDE.md` files and `.claude/rules/*.md` files give your agent persistent context about your project: coding conventions, build commands, architecture decisions, and instructions. When `settingSources` includes `"project"` (as in the example above), the SDK loads these files into context at session start. The agent then follows your project conventions without you repeating them in every prompt.

### CLAUDE.md load locations

| Level                 | Location                                       | When loaded                                                                                         |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project (root)        | `<cwd>/CLAUDE.md` or `<cwd>/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | `settingSources` includes `"project"`                                                               |
| Project rules         | `<cwd>/.claude/rules/*.md`                     | `settingSources` includes `"project"`                                                               |
| Project (parent dirs) | `CLAUDE.md` files in directories above `cwd`   | `settingSources` includes `"project"`, loaded at session start                                      |
| Project (child dirs)  | `CLAUDE.md` files in subdirectories of `cwd`   | `settingSources` includes `"project"`, loaded on demand when the agent reads a file in that subtree |
| Local (gitignored)    | `<cwd>/CLAUDE.local.md`                        | `settingSources` includes `"local"`                                                                 |
| User                  | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`                          | `settingSources` includes `"user"`                                                                  |
| User rules            | `~/.claude/rules/*.md`                         | `settingSources` includes `"user"`                                                                  |

All levels are additive: if both project and user CLAUDE.md files exist, the agent sees both. There is no hard precedence rule between levels; if instructions conflict, the outcome depends on how Claude interprets them. Write non-conflicting rules, or state precedence explicitly in the more specific file ("These project instructions override any conflicting user-level defaults").

<Tip>
  You can also inject context directly via `systemPrompt` without using CLAUDE.md files. See [Modify system prompts](/en/agent-sdk/modifying-system-prompts). Use CLAUDE.md when you want the same context shared between interactive Claude Code sessions and your SDK agents.
</Tip>

For how to structure and organize CLAUDE.md content, see [Manage Claude's memory](/en/memory).

## Skills

Skills are markdown files that give your agent specialized knowledge and invocable workflows. Unlike `CLAUDE.md` (which loads every session), skills load on demand. The agent receives skill descriptions at startup and loads the full content when relevant.

To use skills in the SDK, set `settingSources` so the agent discovers skill files from the filesystem. The `Skill` tool is enabled by default when you don't specify `allowedTools`. If you are using an `allowedTools` allowlist, include `"Skill"` explicitly.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions, ResultMessage

  # Skills in .claude/skills/ are discovered automatically
  # when settingSources includes "project"
  async for message in query(
      prompt="Review this PR using our code review checklist",
      options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
          setting_sources=["user", "project"],
          allowed_tools=["Skill", "Read", "Grep", "Glob"],
      ),
  ):
      if isinstance(message, ResultMessage) and message.subtype == "success":
          print(message.result)
  ```

  ```typescript TypeScript theme={null}
  import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

  // Skills in .claude/skills/ are discovered automatically
  // when settingSources includes "project"
  for await (const message of query({
    prompt: "Review this PR using our code review checklist",
    options: {
      settingSources: ["user", "project"],
      allowedTools: ["Skill", "Read", "Grep", "Glob"]
    }
  })) {
    if (message.type === "result" && message.subtype === "success") {
      console.log(message.result);
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  Skills must be created as filesystem artifacts (`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`). The SDK does not have a programmatic API for registering skills. See [Agent Skills in the SDK](/en/agent-sdk/skills) for full details.
</Note>

For more on creating and using skills, see [Agent Skills in the SDK](/en/agent-sdk/skills).

## Hooks

The SDK supports two ways to define hooks, and they run side by side:

* **Filesystem hooks:** shell commands defined in `settings.json`, loaded when `settingSources` includes the relevant source. These are the same hooks you'd configure for [interactive Claude Code sessions](/en/hooks-guide).
* **Programmatic hooks:** callback functions passed directly to `query()`. These run in your application process and can return structured decisions. See [Control execution with hooks](/en/agent-sdk/hooks).

Both types execute during the same hook lifecycle. If you already have hooks in your project's `.claude/settings.json` and you set `settingSources: ["project"]`, those hooks run automatically in the SDK with no extra configuration.

Hook callbacks receive the tool input and return a decision dict. Returning `{}` (an empty dict) means allow the tool to proceed. Returning `{"decision": "block", "reason": "..."}` prevents execution and the reason is sent to Claude as the tool result. See the [hooks guide](/en/agent-sdk/hooks) for the full callback signature and return types.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions, HookMatcher, ResultMessage


  # PreToolUse hook callback. Positional args:
  #   input_data: HookInput dict with tool_name, tool_input, hook_event_name
  #   tool_use_id: str | None, the ID of the tool call being intercepted
  #   context: HookContext, carries session metadata
  async def audit_bash(input_data, tool_use_id, context):
      command = input_data.get("tool_input", {}).get("command", "")
      if "rm -rf" in command:
          return {"decision": "block", "reason": "Destructive command blocked"}
      return {}  # Empty dict: allow the tool to proceed


  # Filesystem hooks from .claude/settings.json run automatically
  # when settingSources loads them. You can also add programmatic hooks:
  async for message in query(
      prompt="Refactor the auth module",
      options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
          setting_sources=["project"],  # Loads hooks from .claude/settings.json
          hooks={
              "PreToolUse": [
                  HookMatcher(matcher="Bash", hooks=[audit_bash]),
              ]
          },
      ),
  ):
      if isinstance(message, ResultMessage) and message.subtype == "success":
          print(message.result)
  ```

  ```typescript TypeScript theme={null}
  import { query, type HookInput, type HookJSONOutput } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

  // PreToolUse hook callback. HookInput is a discriminated union on
  // hook_event_name, so narrowing on it gives TypeScript the right
  // tool_input shape for this event.
  const auditBash = async (input: HookInput): Promise<HookJSONOutput> => {
    if (input.hook_event_name !== "PreToolUse") return {};
    const toolInput = input.tool_input as { command?: string };
    if (toolInput.command?.includes("rm -rf")) {
      return { decision: "block", reason: "Destructive command blocked" };
    }
    return {}; // Empty object: allow the tool to proceed
  };

  // Filesystem hooks from .claude/settings.json run automatically
  // when settingSources loads them. You can also add programmatic hooks:
  for await (const message of query({
    prompt: "Refactor the auth module",
    options: {
      settingSources: ["project"], // Loads hooks from .claude/settings.json
      hooks: {
        PreToolUse: [{ matcher: "Bash", hooks: [auditBash] }]
      }
    }
  })) {
    if (message.type === "result" && message.subtype === "success") {
      console.log(message.result);
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### When to use which hook type

| Hook type                                 | Best for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :---------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Filesystem** (`settings.json`)          | Sharing hooks between CLI and SDK sessions. Supports `"command"` (shell scripts), `"http"` (POST to an endpoint), `"prompt"` (LLM evaluates a prompt), and `"agent"` (spawns a verifier agent). These fire in the main agent and any subagents it spawns. |
| **Programmatic** (callbacks in `query()`) | Application-specific logic; returning structured decisions; in-process integration. Scoped to the main session only.                                                                                                                                      |

<Note>
  The TypeScript SDK supports additional hook events beyond Python, including `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, `TeammateIdle`, and `TaskCompleted`. See the [hooks guide](/en/agent-sdk/hooks) for the full event compatibility table.
</Note>

For full details on programmatic hooks, see [Control execution with hooks](/en/agent-sdk/hooks). For filesystem hook syntax, see [Hooks](/en/hooks).

<Tip>
  **Subagents versus agent teams:** Subagents are ephemeral and isolated: fresh conversation, one task, summary returned to parent. Agent teams coordinate multiple independent Claude Code instances that share a task list and message each other directly. Agent teams are a CLI feature. See [What subagents inherit](/en/agent-sdk/subagents#what-subagents-inherit) and the [agent teams comparison](/en/agent-teams#compare-with-subagents) for details.
</Tip>

Every feature you enable adds to your agent's context window. For per-feature costs and how these features layer together, see [Extend Claude Code](/en/features-overview#understand-context-costs).
