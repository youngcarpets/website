# Tools reference

> Complete reference for the tools Claude Code can use, including permission requirements.

Claude Code has access to a set of built-in tools that help it understand and modify your codebase. The tool names are the exact strings you use in [permission rules](/en/permissions#tool-specific-permission-rules), [subagent tool lists](/en/sub-agents), and [hook matchers](/en/hooks). To disable a tool entirely, add its name to the `deny` array in your [permission settings](/en/permissions#tool-specific-permission-rules).

To add custom tools, connect an [MCP server](/en/mcp). To extend Claude with reusable prompt-based workflows, write a [skill](/en/skills), which runs through the existing `Skill` tool rather than adding a new tool entry.

Permission rules can be configured using `/permissions` or in [permission settings](/en/settings#available-settings). Also see [Tool-specific permission rules](/en/permissions#tool-specific-permission-rules).

## Bash tool behavior

The Bash tool runs each command in a separate process with the following persistence behavior:

* When Claude runs `cd` in the main session, the new working directory carries over to later Bash commands as long as it stays inside the project directory or an [additional working directory](/en/permissions#working-directories) you added with `--add-dir`, `/add-dir`, or `additionalDirectories` in settings. Subagent sessions never carry over working directory changes.
  * If `cd` lands outside those directories, Claude Code resets to the project directory and appends `Shell cwd was reset to <dir>` to the tool result.
  * To disable this carry-over so every Bash command starts in the project directory, set `CLAUDE_BASH_MAINTAIN_PROJECT_WORKING_DIR=1`.
* Environment variables do not persist. An `export` in one command will not be available in the next.

Activate your virtualenv or conda environment before launching Claude Code. To make environment variables persist across Bash commands, set [`CLAUDE_ENV_FILE`](/en/env-vars) to a shell script before launching Claude Code, or use a [SessionStart hook](/en/hooks#persist-environment-variables) to populate it dynamically.

## LSP tool behavior

The LSP tool gives Claude code intelligence from a running language server. After each file edit, it automatically reports type errors and warnings so Claude can fix issues without a separate build step. Claude can also call it directly to navigate code:

* Jump to a symbol's definition
* Find all references to a symbol
* Get type information at a position
* List symbols in a file or workspace
* Find implementations of an interface
* Trace call hierarchies

The tool is inactive until you install a [code intelligence plugin](/en/discover-plugins#code-intelligence) for your language. The plugin bundles the language server configuration, and you install the server binary separately.

## Monitor tool

<Note>
  The Monitor tool requires Claude Code v2.1.98 or later.
</Note>

The Monitor tool lets Claude watch something in the background and react when it changes, without pausing the conversation. Ask Claude to:

* Tail a log file and flag errors as they appear
* Poll a PR or CI job and report when its status changes
* Watch a directory for file changes
* Track output from any long-running script you point it at

Claude writes a small script for the watch, runs it in the background, and receives each output line as it arrives. You keep working in the same session and Claude interjects when an event lands. Stop a monitor by asking Claude to cancel it or by ending the session.

Monitor uses the same [permission rules as Bash](/en/permissions#tool-specific-permission-rules), so `allow` and `deny` patterns you have set for Bash apply here too. It is not available on Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or Microsoft Foundry.

## PowerShell tool

On Windows, Claude Code can run PowerShell commands natively instead of routing through Git Bash. This is an opt-in preview.

### Enable the PowerShell tool

Set `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL=1` in your environment or in `settings.json`:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL": "1"
  }
}
```

Claude Code auto-detects `pwsh.exe` (PowerShell 7+) with a fallback to `powershell.exe` (PowerShell 5.1). The Bash tool remains registered alongside the PowerShell tool, so you may need to ask Claude to use PowerShell.

### Shell selection in settings, hooks, and skills

Three additional settings control where PowerShell is used:

* `"defaultShell": "powershell"` in [`settings.json`](/en/settings#available-settings): routes interactive `!` commands through PowerShell. Requires the PowerShell tool to be enabled.
* `"shell": "powershell"` on individual [command hooks](/en/hooks#command-hook-fields): runs that hook in PowerShell. Hooks spawn PowerShell directly, so this works regardless of `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL`.
* `shell: powershell` in [skill frontmatter](/en/skills#frontmatter-reference): runs `` !`command` `` blocks in PowerShell. Requires the PowerShell tool to be enabled.

The same main-session working-directory reset behavior described under the Bash tool section applies to PowerShell commands, including the `CLAUDE_BASH_MAINTAIN_PROJECT_WORKING_DIR` environment variable.

### Preview limitations

The PowerShell tool has the following known limitations during the preview:

* Auto mode does not work with the PowerShell tool yet
* PowerShell profiles are not loaded
* Sandboxing is not supported
* Only supported on native Windows, not WSL
* Git Bash is still required to start Claude Code

## Check which tools are available

Your exact tool set depends on your provider, platform, and settings. To check what's loaded in a running session, ask Claude directly:

```text  theme={null}
What tools do you have access to?
```

Claude gives a conversational summary. For exact MCP tool names, run `/mcp`.
